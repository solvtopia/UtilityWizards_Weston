It also requires the creditor to reference all recorded assignments in the publications of the notice of sale. Section 2 of the bill creates two new statutes of Chapter 244 - Section 35B This statute provides that on certain mortgage loans a creditor cannot publish the notice of sale without first taking reasonable steps and a good faith effort to avoid foreclosure. - Section 35C prohibits a creditor from doing any of the following in connection with a foreclosure on a loan that is secured by a mortgage on a 1-4 family residential property occupied by the borrower as his or her principal residence."		1/30/2018

When the sale date is assigned, we will update LPS and CONFIRM the sale date accordingly. It is a county delay and is beyond our control.  This property is in Monroe County.  The average delay is 18-24 months from when package is submitted to the court.  The 18-24 month delay is the time it takes for the sheriff to assign a sale date for the property.  This is how the Monroe County sheriff operates.  We cannot make the Sheriff list these properties for sale any sooner."		1/30/2018

This requires the Beneficiary to request a resolution conference with the grantors under the deed of trust, and may require the Beneficiary to participate in such a conference should the grantor(s) opt-into the program. We will make this request on the Beneficiary?Коs behalf and diligently work towards obtaining a Certificate of Compliance.  We will launch a mediation process should the borrower opt-into mediation.  If the borrower does not opt-in we will obtain an automatic certificate of compliance in about 60 days.  Until we obtain that certificate we cannot work any foreclosure-related processes as this could violate dual-tracking prohibitions.   We will remove the hold once we have obtained the Certificate of Compliance. Oregon SB558."		1/30/2018

Currently we must review all NOIs for compliance.  Upon review of the NOI previously sent it has come to our attention it is deficient by the NJ Court Standards. The client has been advised. We must wait for a Remediated NOI to be sent, 30 days for it to expire and have in place a complaint review process before we can proceed with the foreclosure."	This does not qualify for a court delay hold. The court delay is only used in the 1st legal stage when recording the Assignment or SOT. Thank you	1/30/2018
